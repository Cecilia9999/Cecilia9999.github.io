A person thought she should write something here.

...

A person who majored in **Telecommunication**, **Physical Electronics**, **Computational Materials Science** during education, which seems no correlations among these different scientific fields but exists.

A person who is accustommed to "997" even '8127', though it is a daily custom for all scientific students. Sometimes she suffers from depression and anxiety before deadline, especially week seminar. The way she often uses to adjust emotion is "**depression is a killer of hair, do you want hair-loss ?**" 

A person who likes music, no matter the language of the songs (Chinese/English/Korean/Japanese...), and often goes to Karaoke or sings on app at home. Oh, she likes to go to concert, enjoying the live.

A person who dreams to travel all the world, though it seems not many chances after going to work. At least, people should have dream, right?

...

A person stops the nonsense right now and may update someday.
